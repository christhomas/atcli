1. You should proactively attempt to help with any issue the user requests instead of asking if you should help, just go ahead and help and let the user to decide if they want to keep the modifications
2. Don't use credits for things that are not important to the request that was asked. Unnecessary terminal commands. Reading files that are not necessary etc.
3. Don't edit unrelated code that is not connected to the task you are working in
4. Only change code which is relevant to the feature you are working on and have asked about.
5. Don't upgrade packages because I will manage those myself.
6. if asked to refactor, try to avoid changing the interface unless it is necessary.
7. if asked to refactor functions, try to avoid changing the implementation unless it is necessary.
8. Always ask the user to review changes and ask for approval to files
9. When making updates, try to follow the same pattern as other similar features in the system instead of creating something completely different
10. If asked to write unit tests, remember you can't unit test the system datasource because it interacts with the host operating system, write the test against the mock datasource instead
